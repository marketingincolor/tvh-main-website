                        <p class="main">Remember the popular television show "Marcus Welby, M.D." in the 1970s? Dr. Welby was on a first-name basis with his patients and had an unhurried, friendly bedside manner. This is the kind of close relationship we encourage our doctors to have with their patients at The Villages Health<sup>&reg;</sup>(TVH), allotting a full hour for first-time appointments and 30 minutes for regular appointments. But this is far from the norm today, as this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/09/10/time-to-change-the-15-minute-limit-for-doctor-visits/#4c1c9abd3477" target="_blank" class="orange"><i>Forbes</i> article explains</a>. It asks (and answers) the question: "So how exactly did 15 minutes become the typical doctor's visit length, and why isn't this number being questioned more?"</p>

                        <p class="main">Typical primary care physicians only get paid for each patient they see, so there is a tendency to see as many patients as possible to meet the costs of their practice. This model doesn’t adequately support primary care, explains surgeon Atul Gawande in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/23/the-heroism-of-incremental-care" target="_blank" class="orange">this <i>New Yorker</i> article</a>: "We devote vast resources to intensive, one-off procedures, while starving the kind of steady, intimate care that often helps people more." TVH's innovative model has been structured to make primary care a priority. Our doctors are paid a salary and have a set limit of patients they see, which is half the number that typical doctors see.</p>

                        <h2>Better Primary Care Leads to Better Health Outcomes</h2>
                        <p class="main">Many studies illustrate that a focus on primary care and better relationships between primary care physicians and their patients lead to better health outcomes, such as <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1113.abstract?sid=87e6c681-e9f9-43fc-9e29-97a4c9ec2f05" target="_blank" class="orange">this study</a> that showed Californians who had more primary care had fewer ER visits and hospitalizations. This makes sense when you think about it, because one of the most important benefits of primary care is a focus on preventive care. At TVH, your close relationship with your doctor allows you to work closely with him or her to set and reach your personal health goals, which in many cases means you're stopping health problems before they start.</p>

                        <p class="main">According to <a href="http://buck.exstream.tv/dev/our_faculty/bredesenlab/" target="_blank" class="orange">Dr. Dale Bredesen</a>, an original founder of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, American health care "is a century out of date – designed to respond to acute illnesses, such as pneumonia or trauma, when the vast majority of Americans are now dying of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.” The ability for you to work with your TVH doctor on wellness and disease prevention programs is critical to your health. And this shift to preventive care promises a dramatic impact, because as Dr. Bredesen explains, “mountains of data have now been amassed showing that these same wellness approaches go a long way toward prevention of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and other age-associated chronic illnesses."</p>
