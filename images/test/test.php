      Inventing A New Paradigm For Primary Care</span></p>
    <p class="captions">The Villages is a phenomenon, becoming
      the largest over 55 community by far in the U.S in
      only 25 years. In a league of its own, The Villages has taken the concept of a
      “planned community” to a level never before seen&#8212;anywhere. Yet, The
      Villages suffers what our nation suffers: an unhealthy health care “system,” in
      which patients consistently express considerable dissatisfaction with
      everything from care-access to care-quality. Thankfully, a new vision for a
      health care <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>system</i></b> has been brought forth. Those who reside within The
      Villages will soon not only enjoy a world-class model of a planned community,
      but also a very novel and profoundly superior health care system, as noteworthy
      and exemplary as the community itself. America’s Friendliest Hometown is about
    to become America’s Healthiest Hometown. <a href="../newparadigm.html" target="_blank" class="bolds">READ MORE</a></p>
