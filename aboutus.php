  <p class="text">The Villages Health offers a revolutionary style of care that puts the patient at the center of their own well being!</p>
  <p class="text">We're excited to offer our residents an exciting new medical home, where the focus is on you. Imagine a doctor who will greet you by name, treat you as a friend, and grow old with you - just a golf car ride away - here in your very own hometown. Every doctor has agreed to limit the number of patients they serve, in an effort to slow down and get to know you better. And they're quite excited about the opportunity!</p>
  <p class="text">    Each doctor serves as the captain of a team of professionals dedicated to your better health. Information is shared freely amongst 
    the team, so that everyone involved with your well being is part of the same plan for your success. </p>
  <p class="text">A better way to take care of yourself, right here, in America's Healthiest Hometown!</p>
