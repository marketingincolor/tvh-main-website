                        <p class="main">Although The Villages Health<sup>&reg;</sup> (TVH) continues to grow our Specialty Care capabilities, we don't have 100 percent coverage of all specialties. There are times when you'll have specialty needs that we don't currently provide, or you may prefer to see a specialist outside of TVH. This is one of the reasons we partnered with UnitedHealthcare. We want to give you the depth and breadth of the specialists and hospitals participating in the UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plans. We also think you might be interested in learning about some new benefits available with plans we accept, that extend your access to all physicians and hospitals that participate in the Medicare program.</p>
                        <p class="main">One of the concerns we hear from patients when they're considering switching from a Medicare Supplemental plan to a Medicare Advantage plan is where they can receive care if they require hospitalization. We believe a majority of services should be available within the community to allow patients to receive support from family and friends. However, we want our patients to have excellent options if they choose to leave the community.</p>
                        <p class="main">Tampa General is a major teaching hospital approximately 90 minutes away, ranked #3 overall in the state by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. The hospital also ranks nationally in six specialty areas and is ranked as a high-performer in three others. Orlando Regional, another nearby hospital, ranks #11 overall in the state, and Cleveland Clinic, a bit further away, ranks #5 in the state. All are currently accepting UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage.</p>
