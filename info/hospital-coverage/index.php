                        <p class="main">The Villages Health (TVH) continues to grow our Specialty Care capabilities although there are times when you may have specialty needs that we don't currently provide, or you may prefer to see a specialist outside of TVH. You may be interested in learning about some new benefits available with the insurance plans we accept, that extend your access to all physicians and hospitals that participate in the Medicare program.</p>
                        <p class="main">One of the concerns we hear from patients when they're considering switching from a Medicare Supplemental plan to a Medicare Advantage plan is where they can receive care if they require hospitalization. We believe a majority of services should be available within the community to allow patients to receive support from family and friends. Because being able to receive excellent care in the community you live in is so important, we provide TVH Hospitalists and Nurse Navigators to our patients with Medicare Advantage who are hospitalized at The Villages Regional Hospital. However, we want our patients to be aware of their options if they choose to leave the community.</p>
                        <p class="main">Many nationally ranked hospitals and specialists accept Medicare Advantage plans. Tampa General is a major teaching hospital approximately 90 minutes away, ranked #3 overall in the state by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. The hospital also ranks nationally in six specialty areas and is ranked as a high-performer in three others. Orlando Regional, another hospital nearby The Villages, ranks #11 overall in the state. Cleveland Clinic, with locations in both Weston and West Palm Beach, ranks #5 in the state.
