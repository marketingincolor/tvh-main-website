    <p class="text">  <span class="h1">Same Day Appointments</span><br />
  Now that you are established, please call your Care Center if you find yourself in a situation where you need same-day assistance.  You will be cared for that day by either your physician or another within the Clinical Team at your Care Center.</p>
    <p class="text"><img src="images/line.png" width="800" height="30" /></p>
    <p class="h1">ON-SITE PATIENT SERVICES</p>
    <p class="text"><span class="h1">Audiology</span><br />
    We have board certified audiologists on-site.  They provide a full line of services including hearing loss evaluation and diagnosis, balance assessments, and hearing aid dispensing that fits your lifestyle.</p>
    <p class="text"> <span class="h1">Lab Services </span><br />
      Our Care Center labs are available for same day testing and blood draws between 7:00am-3:00pm.  If your physician decides you need to have any of these services performed while you are here for an appointment, your lab test will be completed on-site at that time.<br />
      <strong><em>Scheduled lab appointments may be subject to a copay.</em></strong><em></em></p>
    <p class="text"> <span class="h1">X-ray and other Testing</span><br />
      General imaging, EKG, pulmonary function and other common diagnostic tests are performed in your Care Center. </p>
    <p class="text"><span class="h1">Procedures</span><br />
      Our physicians perform common medical procedures on-site in each Care Center. These  include skin biopsy and excision, <span class="text">laceration repair, joint injections, intravenous (IV) rehydration and other common procedures.</span></p>
    <p class="text"><img src="images/line.png" width="800" height="30" /></p>
   
    <p class="text"><span class="h1">Your Clinical Team</span><br />
      You have a personal physician at our Care Center who leads a team in caring for you. When you are served by any other member of the team, please know that you are receiving your physician's care through these team members.  Your medical team meets with your doctor as soon as possible to communicate the details your visit.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="text"><span class="h1">Medical Record</span><br />
      Your Care Center physician will advise you if any record is needed from an outside source. The most important information for your health care team at your first appointment is a detailed medical history summary which includes the dates of your last colonoscopy, mammogram, vaccinations, any surgical history, the results of your most recent labs and EKG, and a complete list of prescription medications and supplements that you are currently taking.</p>
    <p class="text"><span class="h1">Specialists</span><br />
      Whether you are a patient of TVH Primary Care or you see a primary care physician outside of The Villages Health, you can also choose from a growing number of specialty physicians in The Villages Health, including specialists in cardiology, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, endocrinology, rheumatology, gynecology, neurology, gastroenterology, audiology, and psychiatry. We will expand to include dermatology this fall.</p>

      <p>If you have a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan,  you will also have access to 20,000 specialty physicians participating in the UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage network – Florida’s largest. As a patient of TVH Primary Care, your primary care physician will help coordinate any specialty care you need.</p>
    <p class="text"> <span class="h1">Hospital</span><br />
    If you have a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan and are hospitalized, your care will be provided by one of our Hospitalists, who has access to your outpatient medical record while in The Villages® Regional Hospital. You will also be seen by a TVH Nurse Navigator to assist in the coordination of your care plan, discharge, and any follow up care needed.</p>
