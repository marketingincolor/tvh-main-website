<blockquote>
  <p><span class="h1">What is a Patient Centered Medical Home and how does this differ from the typical physician office?</span><br />
    Each patient has an ongoing relationship with a primary care physician who leads a team of individuals for ongoing patient care. The primary care physician is responsible for 
    coordinating all the patient's health care needs. The care with enhanced access is coordinated and integrated to ensure quality and safety and is just a golf car ride away for Villagers. </p>
  <p><span class="h1">How many primary care doctors serve The Villages and how many patients does each physician have?</span><br />
    Our goal is to have eight (8) board certified primary care physicians in each Care Center. <br />
    We limit each doctor to a maximum of 1250 patients, half the size of the usual patient panel.</p>
  <p><span class="h1">How do I decide which care center to go to?</span><br />
    Complete the <a href="http://www.thevillageshealth.com/newpatientinformation.php">new patient information form</a> and a representative from The Villages Health will contact you to help you select a primary care physician. </p>
<!--<p><span class="h1">Will my Primary Care Physician visit me in the hospital?</span><br />
    A Care Center physician will visit you in The Villages Regional Hospital and may work 
    with a hospitalist to manage your care while you are in The Villages Regional hospital.</p>-->
  <p><span class="h1">Will there be any additional expenses over and above what my insurance pays
    and is it my typical co-insurance or co-pay?</span><br />
    For covered services, there should be no additional expenses above any applicable co-pay 
    or deductible amounts. If there are medical services desired that are not covered by your insurance, those will be charged for separately.</p>
  <!-- <p><span class="h1">Are the Care Centers solely for Villages Residents?</span><br />
    The Care Centers will be accepting new patients who are residents of The Villages 
    until such time as all residents have been invited to become members (subject, of course, 
    to any requirements of our managed care plans or law).</p> -->
  <p><span class="h1">What is Medicare Advantage and how is it different than regular Medicare?</span><br />
    Medicare Advantage (Part C) is a Medicare coverage option. It offers the same coverage 
    you get with Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) and often prescription drug coverage (Part D) â€“ all in one plan. Medicare Advantage plans may also offer additional benefits beyond doctor and hospital visits.</p>
