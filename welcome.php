<p class="h1">Welcome to a new era of healthcare that centers around <em>YOU</em>!</p>
<p class="text">The care centers provide your neighborhood medical home where members develop an ongoing relationship with their personal physician and feel welcome to contact us first — no matter what the problem is — for comprehensive medical care. Your personal physician leads a team of skilled and caring professionals who provide a  &quot;whole person&quot; approach to your care including behavioral health issues. All members of your household are welcome to establish their care with the same medical team.</p>
<p><span class="h1">When you become a patient you will have
  the peace of mind in knowing that...</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>...your family doctor is just a short golf car ride away from your home.</p>
  <p>...your Villages Health Care Center medical team will have 
    the time to get to know you, your family and your medical needs.</p>
  <p>...an electronic medical record system will help ensure that 
    you won't experience duplication of unnecessary tests and procedures.</p>
  <p>...you will have access to your medical team on the same day in most cases if you need them.</p>
