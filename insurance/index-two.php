        Since The Villages Health (TVH) opened our doors in 2012, we have set out to be different – to provide a higher level of care for our patients. We designed TVH to allow you to spend more time with your physician, access care when you need it, and coordinate your health care. We knew that not only would this make your experience more pleasant but it would also result in better health outcomes for you. <br><br>
        In a quality rating system used throughout the country, we recently received a 5-star rating in 13 out of 15 categories and a 4-star rating in the remaining 2 categories. As a result, TVH is again #1 in all of North and Central Florida. <br><br>

      <h1 class="insurance">Accepted Insurance Changes</h1>
    
    <p class="insurance">
        Starting January 1, 2017 The Villages Health has decided to no longer accept Original Medicare with a medicare Supplemental policy for all new 
        and existing patients.  Because we are committed to bringing you the very best in care, we have found Medicare Advantage best aligns with our 
        health care model. Existing patients who currently have Medicare with a Medicare Supplement Policy will need to be enrolled in a UnitedHealthcare 
        Medicare Advantage plan to remain a patient with The Villages Health. <br><br>

        We hope you will watch the attached video to better understand why The Villages Health made this insurance change.

      <p class="insurance">
        It is our hope you will choose one of the Medicare Advantage plans from UnitedHealthcare in the upcoming enrollment period (October 15- December 7). <br><br>
        For more information on how Medicare Advantage can provide better outcomes, often for less money, we recommend you contact your local insurance agent, visit a Medicare Resource Center in one of TVH Care Centers, or visit a Medicare Store located in one of The Villages’ three town squares. <br><br>
