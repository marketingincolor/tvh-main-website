<p>An exciting change has taken place at our practice.</p>
<p>Family Doctors of Belleview, whom you have trusted with your family&rsquo;s health, is growing. We have joined with The Villages Health and effective July 1<sup>st</sup> only our name will change. Your FDB doctor will still be your Villages Health doctor.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? It means you will see and hear some changes at our practice in the coming weeks such as - </p>
<ul>
<li>When you come to the practice, you will see new signs reflecting our new name.</li>
<li>When you receive your reminder calls, you will hear that you have an appointment at The Villages Health Care Center either in Belleview or in Sharon Morse Medical Center. </li>
<li>When you call the office you will hear, &ldquo;Thank you for calling The Villages Health Belleview (or Sharon Morse), how may I help you today?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Our website will be changing. If you go to our current website, <a href="http://www.245-9157.com">www.245-9157.com</a>, you will be redirected to The Villages Health website: TheVillagesHealth.com.</li>
<li>We encourage you to activate your new Villages Health patient medical record account. This will allow you to see your medical history, make appointments, request prescription refills, see your lab results and leave messages for your health team.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not signed up for your online medical record account please call our Belleview office at 352-674-1730 or our Sharon Morse office at 352-674-1720 to get your user name and password to access your secure Villages Health medical record account.</p>
<p>If you already have your user name and password enter the following address in your web browser address bar, or click on the following link <a href="https://health.eclinicalworks.com/tvhportal">https://health.eclinicalworks.com/tvhportal</a>.</p>
<p>What hasn&rsquo;t changed are the physicians and familiar faces you are used to seeing when you come to the practice, as well as the excellent care and customer service you are accustomed to receiving.</p>
<p>We are excited as we move forward to the next phase of this endeavor and want to assure you that we will make this transition as seamless as possible for you, our valued patient.</p>
<p>Sincerest Regards, </p>
<p><i>Family</i> Doctors of Belleview</p>
